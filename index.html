        <h1>Real-Time Clock Widget</h1>
        <p>
            This is a lightweight clock and date widget built with modern and efficient vanilla JavaScript.
            The widget is fixed to the top-right corner and stays visible while scrolling, making it ideal for
            dashboards or informational pages.

        <h2>Technical Deep Dive</h2>
        <p>
            This project is more than just a visual element; it's a practical demonstration of several key JavaScript
            best practices.
        </p>

        <h3>Efficient Timing with <code>setInterval</code></h3>
        <p>
            A common approach for clocks is using a recursive <code>setTimeout</code>, but this can lead to "timing
            drift" over long periods as small delays in execution accumulate. This widget uses
            <strong><code>setInterval(callback, 1000)</code></strong> to ensure the clock function is triggered every
            second as accurately as possible, providing a more stable and efficient solution.
        </p>

        <h3>Modern Internationalization with the <code>Intl</code> API</h3>
        <p>
            Hardcoding day and month names (e.g., "Monday", "January") makes a script rigid and difficult to localize.
            This widget avoids that entirely by leveraging the browser's built-in
            <strong><code>Intl.DateTimeFormat</code></strong> API. This powerful feature allows the date to be instantly
            displayed in any language and locale (e.g., <code>'tr-TR'</code> for Turkish, <code>'en-US'</code> for
            American English, or <code>'de-DE'</code> for German) without changing the core logic.
        </p>

        <h3>Clean Code and Scope Management</h3>
        <p>
            To avoid potential conflicts with other scripts on a page, the entire application is encapsulated within an
            <strong>Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)</strong>. This keeps all variables and functions out
            of the global scope, a crucial practice for writing reusable and maintainable JavaScript components.
        </p>

        <h3>Fixed Positioning and Styling</h3>
        <p>
            The widget's ability to stay in place during scrolling is achieved with the simple but effective CSS rule
            <strong><code>position: fixed;</code></strong>. A high <code>z-index</code> (implicit or explicit) ensures
            it renders on top of other page content. The styling is intentionally minimal to be easily integrated into
            various designs.
